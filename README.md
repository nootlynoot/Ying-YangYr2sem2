Tower defence game in poly yr2 sem2. This is the tower defense game I  worked on as the programming lead for my second year. It features a unique color changing mechanic where the player controls the turrets color and by match the color of the turrets and enemies, allows the turrets to open fire. The outcome of the game was really desirable and managed to capture the use of black and white pretty nicely. Personally I am in charge of coding the new mechanics, turrets, and cooperating with artists to incorporate specific model animations and textures into the game.
